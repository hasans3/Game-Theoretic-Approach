# Game-Theoretic-Approach for Static Attack Scenario

This folder contains the respective methods and supporting files needed for identifying static attack strategies.
To run the attack method, the following steps are needed:
1. Install the OpenDSS on the Windows machine as OpenDSS is not mac compatible.
2. Download and save the system models from the "System Models" folder to the local drive. 
3. Intal Spyder, PyCharm or any other Python IDE.
4. Open the "static_attack_subs_v2_test.py" method and set the paths for the filepath, comp_filename, load_file_name as per the 
directory where the downloaded files are stored from the "System Models" folder. 
5. The method "static_attack_subs_v2_test.py" can be now used for identifying the most damaging attacks by setting the appropriate 
attack budgets represented by p_budget and s_budget.
